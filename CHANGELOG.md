### Added

- Project tooling: Vite, React, TypeScript, Vitest, ESLint, and Prettier.
- Repository rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
- A `commit-msg` git hook that rejects commit messages carrying AI attribution.
- Core music engine in `src/core`, independent of the browser:
  - a parser for numbered-notation song files (header, melody, chords, lyrics, sections);
  - chord-symbol parsing and note spelling relative to the key;
  - left-hand notation written in chord-relative degrees, including stacked notes;
  - the baseline left hand (root, fifth, octave on the printed chords);
  - arrangement validation (range, hand span, low close intervals, slash-chord bass, clashes
    with the melody);
  - conversion of a song and an arrangement into timed note events.
- `npm run check`, a command-line checker for song folders, with `--dump` to list the left-hand
  notes of every measure.
- The song and arrangement file format, documented in `docs/song-format.md`.
- A public-domain demo song, "Amazing Grace", with three left-hand arrangements.
